We present The bolometric SLSN lightcurves in different energy-loss scenarios, and the evolution of the gamma-ray trapping factor and ejecta radius.

time: unit is day;
lc: bolometric luminosity of lightcurve in logrithmic scale, unit is erg/s;
Ni_decay: bolometric luminosity of SN powered by Ni56 radioactive chain, in logrithmic scale, unit is erg/s;
eta: trapping factor;
R_ej: radius of ejecta in logrithmic scale, unit is cm.
