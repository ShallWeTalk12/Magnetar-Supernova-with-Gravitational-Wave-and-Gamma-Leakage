# Magnetar-Supernova-with-Gravitational-Wave-and-Gamma-Leakage
Data from figures of arXiv:2508.18940, i.e., *Lightcurve Features of Magnetar-Powered Superluminous Supernovae with Gravitational-Wave Emission and High-Energy Leakage*. 8 Figures in total.

Notation system (also see eq.6):
- Case I: only consider electromagnetic (EM) radiation;
- Case II: EM radiation + mountain-driven gravitational wave (GW) emission;
- Case III: EM radiation + r-mode-driven GW emission.
